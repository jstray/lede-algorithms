      "                      February 1, 2012\n",
      "                     WASHINGTON – United States Senator Robert Menendez (D-NJ) participated in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on Ukraine today, giving him the opportunity to meet Eugenia Tymoshenko and to discuss the inhumane detention of her mother, the former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko.  Last October, a Ukrainian court sentenced Yulia Tymoshenko to seven years in prison after she was found guilty of abuse of office when brokering a 2009 gas deal with Russia.  The Senator expressed his sympathy and support to Ms. Tymoshenko and vowed to assist in her efforts to have her mother freed from prison.\n",
      "\n",
      " “Your mother is a pioneering and incredibly strong woman,” the Senator told the younger Tymoshenko. “Yulia is an example for all people who care so much about their country that they are willing to endure extraordinary hardship and not just lay down in the face of oppression and cruelty. I think this hearing is a wonderful way to inform the American people not only about your mother, but the other opposition leaders in jail and to keep the pressure on the Ukrainian authorities to give Yulia her freedom back.”\n",
      " “Every day the human rights situation in Ukraine worsens and it’s starting to remind me of the shameful conditions of the Soviet era.  Yulia Tymoshenko worked very hard to throw off the tyranny of the Soviet past, and to see her and other opposition leaders in jail cells is a reminder of how much work remains to be done to improve human rights and political freedom in today’s Ukraine.  We must convince President Yanukovych that Ukraine’s path to freedom and economic prosperity is not through Soviet-style centralized government, but by way of releasing the power, intelligence and dignity of the Ukrainian people while respecting the rights of all its citizens,” added Menendez.\n",

      "                     WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senators Robert Menendez (D-NJ) and Frank R. Lautenberg (D-NJ) announced that the Department of Transportation has awarded $4,300,000 in funds to the National Transit Institute (NTI). The Institute was established in 1991 under the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) with the objective of developing, promoting, and delivering quality training, education, and clearinghouse services for the public transit industry. Its primary objective is to develop, deliver, and promote quality programs and materials via cooperative partnerships with industry, government, institutions, and associations around the country. “As we know well in New Jersey, public transit helps families save time and money and helps clear the air we breathe,” said Menendez. “An emphasis on public transit will be critical to rebuilding our economy because of its potential to create new jobs, cut energy costs and traffic congestion and reduce pollution. This federal investment will not only help support a renewed focus on public transit, but it will help New Jersey and Rutgers continue to lead the way.” “As more people across the country are taking mass transit than ever before, it’s critical that we have the most up to date research to keep our transit systems moving safely and efficiently,” Lautenberg said. “This federal funding will continue the vital research that the National Transit Institute has been conducting since 1991.”  Since its founding in 1991, NTI has developed 149 courses and other training materials in collaboration with the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) and the public transit industry in response to their needs. New courses are developed every year to adapt to changes in the industry. In recent years, NTI modernized its educational approach to include the use of visual digital resources outside the classroom. Including the current fiscal year, NTI has been awarded a total of $79.7 million in federal funds since it was established in 1991.

      "                     WASHINGTON – Following today’s approval by the Senate Banking Committee of the Federal Public Transportation Act of 2012, U.S. Senator Robert Menendez (D-NJ), Chairman of the Subcommittee on Housing, Transportation and Community Development, called the bipartisan legislation “an incredible boon to New Jersey.”  By cutting waste and eliminating earmarks, the bill will provide New Jersey $519 million in federal transit funding, an increase of over $63 million per year.  If passed by the full Senate and House, New Jersey would receive more federal transit funding per year than ever before -- without increased overall federal spending.\n",
      "\n",
      "“For over two years now, I have worked across party lines to help craft a bill that will invest in our infrastructure and improve public transportation for New Jersey families and commuters,”“This bill provides our state more federal transit funding than it has ever received before.   What does more funding mean?  It means more resources to protect and create good paying jobs and more funds to make the improvements we need to ease congestion and delays.”    said Menendez. \n",
      "\n",
      "Menendez also applauded the inclusion of a number of provisions he championed including:\n",
      "A New $20 Million Transit Oriented Development Planning Program.  The $20 million program will help communities create more livable communities by planning new development around new transit hubs.  The provision is based on similar language in Senator Menendez’s Livable communities Act, and in New Jersey would work in tandem with the state’s Transit Village program.\n",
      "Increased Funding for the National Transit Institute at Rutgers (NTI) [$5million]. NTI provides training, education, and clearinghouse services in support of public transportation and quality of life for the entire nation.  In recent years this important national program has seen its funding slashed, despite the increased need for training in the face of an ongoing wave of retirements in the industry. This bill will raise NTI’s funding to $5 million per year from $3.8 million.\n",
      "Increased Clean Fuels Program Funding [From $51.5M to $65M].  This competitive program for clean fuel transit vehicles and for refueling infrastructure will help agencies switch from dirty, expensive fuels, to cleaner, cheaper fuels.  This will help improve air quality and allow transit agencies to untether themselves from volatile oil prices.  \n",
      "Increased Funding for Transportation for Seniors and the Disabled [NJ Funding Goes From $6.5 M to $7.8 M]. With demand for senior transportation increasing, the bill is able to meet that demand with increased resources.\n",
      "Streamlined and Reformed “New Starts” Process. The bill streamlines the process for the federal approval of new projects and allows projects designed to increase capacity on existing systems rather than just allow new systems or new lines.  Older systems such as New Jersey’s that are at capacity could, for instance, use the program to add a new station, add another track, or purchase bigger train cars. \n",

      "“For over two years now, we have worked to craft a bill to improve public transportation in New Jersey and across America,” said Menendez, who worked closely with former Chairman Dodd, Chairman Johnson, and Ranking Member Shelby on the bill.  “By wringing out waste and earmarks, the bill provides New Jersey with more federal transit funding than it has ever received before, and does so when NJ Transit desperately needs money to address delays and rider complaints.” \n",

      " “With gasoline prices expected to spike again this summer, we need to invest in public transportation more than ever,” said Menendez.  “This bill stretches the federal dollar further and puts more money directly into our transit systems.  Hopefully, we will pass this bill and provide transit agencies with the resources they need to manage projected ridership increases this summer.”\n",

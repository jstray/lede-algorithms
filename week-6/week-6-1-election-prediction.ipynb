    "And finally, the single biggest reason that the simple election prediction model in this file misses so badly (predicting Clinton's chances in the high 90s): it does not take into account the [correlations between polling errors](https://www.quantamagazine.org/why-nate-silver-sam-wang-and-everyone-else-were-wrong-part-2-20161111/) in different states. If we fix this one factor, even our simple model will give Trump substantially higher chances."

This assumes that the people who are polled (\"likely voters\") are a good representation of the people who actually vote. It is possible to adjust these sorts of factors later, but let's begin with the basics."

    "\n",
    "1) In a real election prediction model, we would combine all the polls according to a weighted average of poll reliability. What \"reliability\" really means is how well the poll matched (predicted) previous election results. We can figure out the optimal combination of poll weights using, for example, linear regression.\n",

    "\n",
    "A poll is meant to tell us how people will vote in an election. But there will be some difference between the last latest polls before an election and the actual election results. According to [this research](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/polling-errors.pdf), US state level presidentail polls in the last three weeks before an election are off by an average of 2%.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we could simply add 2% to our margins of error. But this isn't quite right: when a poll is off in one state, it's often off in other states for similar reasons. The polling error is *correlated.* Not taking into account correlated polling errors were the [biggest reason](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/election-update-why-our-model-is-more-bullish-than-others-on-trump/) that many 2016 election predictions were so badly off."
